/**
 * Delete a request.
 *
 * DELETE /api/requests/[id] — a PENDING request is cancelled by its owner
 * (or an admin): no reason, no cooldown, the row stays as the decision
 * record. A decided request (declined/expired/cancelled/fulfilled) is
 * removed outright by its owner or an admin. Active non-pending statuses
 * 409 — decline/retry are the verbs there.
